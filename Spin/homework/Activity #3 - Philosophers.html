<li><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Download the <a href="philosophers.pml" target="_self">philosophers.pml</a>, containing a model of the dining philosophers problem that can lead to deadlock (because all philosophers are right-handed). Running a Safety verification with no LTL formulae name will detect the deadlock (as we saw in class).</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Update the file to make all philosophers with even _pid's right handed and all those with odd _pid's left handed. Clarity and elegance count.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Run a Safety verification with&nbsp;no LTL formulae - there should no longer be a deadlock.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Deposit your model, named <strong><span style="color: #cf2a27;">exactly</span></strong> <strong>philosophers.pml</strong>, to the Activity #3 dropbox by the start of class on Friday, April 11.</span></p>
